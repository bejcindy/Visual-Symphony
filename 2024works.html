            <h2>Conversation</h2>
            <p>Intertwining nature of modern connectivity and human interaction. As individuals engage in conversation within a circle, they share their diverse thoughts, opinions, and feelings on the profound impacts of modern connectivity. Meanwhile, unnoticed by the participants, a thread is quietly woven around the chair legs upon which they sit. With each passing moment and each layer of conversation, this thread steadily builds, mirroring the increasing complexity of their discussion. Simultaneously, the live interactive system collects the conversation's essence and makes them into ambient music and generative poetry, adding depth and resonance to their dialogue. This imagery evokes the intricate connections between people and technology, where every exchange contributes to the intricate tapestry of human experience.</p>

                <p>Maya Nicholson, English/Irish Artist. Inspired by the intricate connections between modern connectivity and human interaction, the work delves into the essence of dialogue in the digital age. Participants engage in conversations, unaware of the thread quietly weaving around their chair legs, mirroring the complexity of their discussion. The artist serves as the initiator, guiding conversations and fostering creativity. Flexible elements such as thread colour and placement of chairs allow for diverse interpretations, emphasizing the embrace of the unexpected in each unique experience.</p>

            <h2>Gravity - 2000</h2>
            <p>Concept Overview: In dozens of hours of experiments, the building blocks will inevitably collapse, and the process of repeating the construction and collapse has no results or meaning. I feel dull, boring, and unpleasant. Maybe I can endure it at first, but after the accumulation, the building blocks become a torture item for me, making me painful. I tried to force myself to adapt, but then it calmed down, and it did not matter whether I got higher or fell. Maybe I am so numb that I have no emotions either. Each Sisyphus has different reasons for pushing rocks up the mountain, experiencing the absurdity of his creation while struggling up and down. Because of the irresistible nature of the objective world, constant challenges mean possible constant failures. It is nothing more than how people think about it. One must imagine the happiness of Sisyphus, just as one must imagine the happiness of life, although it is secular, repetitive, and can be seen through. Design Concept:  I used two thousand, 5cm x 5cm wooden blocks and surrounded myself in a circular structure with building blocks. This building block structure is constantly being built, collapsed, and built again.In order to fully reproduce the past pleasure of concentration, I must always focus my attention entirely on the blocks. Moreover, I try to confirm if I could feel the joy of being a child again.</p>
            <p>Music Program notes: Gravity – 2000 was inspired by my dear friend, Ziwei Tang’s art performance, Gravity – 2000. During the performance, she used two thousand, 5cm x 5cm wooden blocks to surround herself in a circular structure. During the building process, she had to pay attention to the blocks the entire time since the ring was extremely easily collapsed. According to Ziwei, she wants to use the process of building the ring of blocks to create and reinforce the feelings of her childhood. After I first watched the video performance of this performance art, I was shocked by the powerlessness of thousands of blocks collapsing at one moment with the sense of losing control, and I was immediately inspired to write a piece that expresses complex emotions and catches each emotional transitions along side of the video of this art performance. These emotions include hope, stress, tension, anxiety, and feelings of the sublime. I’m reminded of the excitement of throwing ping pong balls inside the piano in my last prepared piano, Lost on Penrose Stairs. I used extended flute techniques to capture the performers’ facial expressions as the blocks shockingly collapsed. With the flute’s extended technique, and the screaming while playing, the flute part reflects the frustration of the inevitable collapse and the uncertainty. The first movement set up the mood of building the ring blocks. During the second movement, the cello emerges from the backdrop of chaos playing the main theme from Johannes Brahms’s Lullaby, and it is reminiscent of childhood.</p>

            <h2>Marks (2022), Moving Image (M2), 10mins12secs</h2>
            <p>Many marks are left in people's lives, such as inappropriate signatures on historical sites and buildings, or works of art left by land art artists in the vast nature. At the same time, marks can also be left in non-physical ways, such as water, light, people, and things we as human beings are doing at any time. They will pass with time, but they have indeed existed and they could become marks in time and space in some way.</p>
            <p>In this work, Moving image artist Tianhui Tao collaborated with music composer Yunqi Li to complete this moving image work. After the completion of the moving image work, music composer Yunqi Li improvised a second creation of the soundtrack. This moving image work is from one of the works from Tianhui Tao Mark's themed series. This work comes from one of the three parts of the moving image series. In this moving image, the artist records different events happening in the same space as his roommate around the above theme. The works discuss the combination of the same spatial dimension and different temporal dimensions.</p>

            <h2>Marks: My panoramic route before sunset, Photography Collection, (1-16pieces)</h2>
            <p>There are many marks left in people's lives, such as inappropriate signatures on historical sites and buildings, or works of art left by land art artists in the vast nature. At the same time, marks can also be left in non-physical ways, such as water, light, people, and things we as human beings are doing at any time. They will pass with time, but they have indeed existed and they could become marks in time and space in some way.</p>
            <p>This video work was completed in collaboration between artist Tianhui Tao and music composer Ying Gao. After the completion of the photography collection, music composer Ying Gao carried out a second creation. This image work is from the photography collection of artist Tianhui Tao Mark's themed series. What can be seen in the work is the traces left by photography artist Tianhui Tao using light on the road. The panoramic route before sunset. The photography artist used panoramic mode in this work, where the subject and subject of the photo walked along the same route in the artist's undergraduate university in Beijing, China. At the same time, the photographer kept raising the flash on the phone as a non-physical linear marker. Through this method, photography artists can record the light held by a person in a way that changes over time, and every second of light can be recorded in the photo. This also represents that it may be a way to break the rules of "real" photography in the 3D world. (including 4D in the time dimension). This project is a photography collection shot in 16 panoramic modes without any post-processing. When the 16 works of a photography artist are arranged in order, we will also get a panoramic record of walking a whole circle in school. During the shooting process, the photographer recorded the process of sunrise in a short period of time, which also reflects the changes in time and space.</p>

While focusing on traditional Chinese art techniques and the artistic expression of a single pen stroke, this animation also explores themes including language barriers, friendship, and how different forms of art help humanity express the abstract concept of love.

            <p class="subtitle">Video installation; stereo audio composed with shakuhachi and djembe; 3’52; 2023</p>
            <p>Video was first filmed in Portbou, a Spanish town located near the French border, after major wildfires caused by humans. A hand is touching the precarious bark while its powder is flying with the fierce wind. The background sound of shakuhachi is a Japanese end-blown flute, it emphasizes the presence of wind’s screaming while following the hand’s movement. The background music is made by an overlap of several improvised clips, which are intentionally mixed to recreate the touching feeling on bark. Technically, Portbou aims to discover the sound composition in a visual way. This dialogue between audio and visual calls back our sense in a certain way, at the same time, it intrigues us to question: what is human’s position in front of nature after all those human-made disasters?  Finally, a very special thanks to all the participants in the project. The video was filmed in Portbou, Spain; the audio was recorded in École nationale supérieure arts de Paris-Cergy, France and the post-production was realized in Central Saint Martins, UK. Special thanks to Quentin Bonheur for his shakuhachi and djembe improvisation and Laurence Vidil for her performance in the video.Thanks also to Alejandra Riera for her organization of the trip in Portbou. Thanks should also go to Daniel Copley, Edward Lucas, Kimmo Moykky, and Leila Ghouri from CSM Film & Video team for their technical support in post-production.</p>

                <p>Li Shumeng, born in China, actually a MA student in École nationale supérieure d'arts de Paris-Cergy, during which I realized an exchange in Central Saint Martins in the UK. She is a sound artist working with mixed media. Her projects are exhibited in Goldsmiths University of London, Lethaby Gallery of Central Saint Martin, Scène de Recherche of ENS Paris-Saclay and SciencesPo Lille, etc.</p>
                <p>Due to her cross-cultural experience, she questions the concept of « standard », and the way people perceive it in her work. She uses sound as a material at the center of her artistic research, as is a personal way to approach the world, by exploring the materiality of sound. Through this process, new realities are revealed. She is also interested in the notion of « composition ». In this case, she constructs her sound work in a deconstructive way, by experimenting with field recording, vocal and instrumental improvisation and creative writing to question listening ways. </p>
                <p>Her work takes multiform, and is often site-specific, in which the soundscape emerges in combination with immersive technology and visual elements : video, painting and sculpture. She also does live performance within her sound installation, where she gives the freedom to the public to compose their own listening experience.</p>

            <h2>Radio Patterns</h2>
            <p>Patterned information has dominated our daily life – TikTok music, superhero films, internet advertisements, etc. Radio Patterns explores the possibility of generative creativity using heavily modulated and distorted patterned information. The sound art is composed of texts from randomized cosmetic ads as well as texts from the prologue of the opera Pagliacci. The texts from cosmetic ads symbolize patterned information in our life. By using multiple modulation techniques, the spoken texts gradually transform into a cluster of electronic sounds and human speech similar to radio noise. The texts from Pagliacci serve as a sarcastic reflection of the previous text, pointing out that “art is derived from real life” in an overly dramatic and contrasting way.This piece also utilizes the concept of “spoken words are articulated sounds.” By modulating the rhythm and the pitch contour of the spoken words, a new kind of spoken language is formed.</p>
