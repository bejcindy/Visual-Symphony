            <h2>A Bench Grows in the Wild</h2>
            <p class="subtitle">Still Picture Scoring from the Scavenging photograph collection</p>
            <p>A Bench Grows in the Wild takes inspiration from a photograph of an old bench
                surrounded by overgrown shrubs and trees. The piece blends world, electronic, and traditional
                symphonic instruments to evoke the slow transformation of a manmade object as it’s reclaimed by
                nature. What begins as stillness and rust gives way to motion and renewal, reflecting the quiet,
                ongoing relationship between the human and natural worlds — a reminder that everything, in time,
                returns to the earth.</p>
            <p>Scavenging is my third photography book, a quiet reflection on three years of image-making. Divided into
                three chapters—2020, South Shore, and Crossing the Bridge—it traces a personal and collective memory
                shaped by isolation, youth, and change.</p>

            <p>captures fragments from daily walks during lockdown, when the world slowed down to silence.South
                Shore refers to a small community in Yanjiao, where I lived alone during my final years of school.
                Surrounded by friends and neighbors, we cooked, drank, talked, and studied together—a brief, tender
                world recorded not by camera, but by phone: simple, direct, and sincere.</p>

            <p>As The Sheltering Sky reminds us, certain afternoons become inseparable from who we are; these images
                hold that kind of memory.</p>

            <p>Crossing the Bridge reflects the passage between Beijing and Yanjiao, a border charged with exams,
                restrictions, and fleeting hope.</p>
            <p>Together, these photographs form an intimate diary of resilience and belonging amid uncertain times.</p>

            <h2>Fold 呼吸折叠</h2>
            <p>'Fold' is an installation dance video. A rotating installation with three rooms, representing three
                climate issues in a city, a girl who is troubled by climate issues protests in the city, and in this
                adventure, she also discovers that she is the cause of the climate problem.</p>
            <p>The inspiration for "FOLD Breathing Folding" comes from Beijing, where I grew up. There are three unique
                climatic phenomena in Beijing: willow catkins, sandstorms and heavy rain. I have wondered what changes
                this ancient city will undergo when multiple unique climates occur simultaneously in Beijing? So I
                placed them on the same rotating device. These three rooms, which originated from the real climate
                issues in Beijing, together form the core of the film - a rotating, three-room integrated device. I
                regard it as a physical and folded microcosm of the urban climate, a recurring and inescapable
                micro-ecological cage. But isn't such a magical climate change also the result of various social
                problems colliding with each other? Therefore, I designed the walls of the rotating device as movable
                city walls. People in different living areas will subconsciously compete for more living space under the
                climate crisis. Climate threats of different seasons and forms form a continuous oppressive closed loop
                here.</p>

                    Performance:Screen, Central Saint Martins, University of the Arts London. I like to pay attention to
                    social issues such as women and children, and I am good at presenting a virtual world view with
                    beautiful scenery in my works, placing existing social phenomena in the dystopian creative context,
                    and arousing the audience's attention and thinking. The short films I directed were selected for
                    dozens of international film festivals, and some of them triggered academic exchanges and
                    interactions among universities during my undergraduate years. As a curator, I focus on experimental
                    video creation and music creation. Cong Le is the curator and main coordinator of the Visual

            <p>Genie’s Bow observes the life of a young Chinese child model growing up in London, navigating identity

                <p>My name is Jaden Egan and I'm a composer for film and multimedia studying composition at the
                    University of Florida. I have worked in the film/tv industry for over a decade, starting out by
                    modeling for big name brands such as Polo Ralph Lauren, J. Crew, and GAP. I've worked as both talent
                    and crew on a variety of sets ranging from small print jobs to large-scale commercials. Film music
                    has always fascinated me, but it wasn't until high school that I truly took the initiative by
                    beginning learning the guitar. Through my guitar, I developed a unique compositional voice,
                    influenced by romantic music, jazz, classical, and contemporary styles. To me film scoring has
                    brought about the most emotionally intense and provocative art ever created, and I want to be among
                    those who create it.</p>

            <h2>Seaweed vr excerpt</h2>
            <p>This video excerpt is taken from Ziwei Tang’s original VR game created in 2025. In the full version,
                players enter a vast sci-fi world through VR headsets, freely exploring a 360° universe where sound and
                image unfold in continuous motion. The complete experience features music that evolves gradually with
                the player’s journey, deepening the sense of immersion and wonder.</p>
            <p>For this video version, the composer Monstar Cao reimagined the sound world as a simulation—a glimpse
                into the atmosphere of the full interactive piece. Drawing from extended timbres and ever-shifting synth
                pads, the music aims to evoke a dreamlike landscape, where sonic textures drift between reality and
                imagination, inviting the listener into a quietly immersive space.</p>

                <p>Ziwei Tang is an artist based in London whose practice explores the intersections of ecology,
                    spirituality, and posthuman thought. Drawing from anthropology and shamanic traditions, her work
                    investigates the perceptual and ethical structures that shape the relationship between human and
                    nonhuman beings. Through installation, sound, and ritual interventions, she seeks to evoke the
                    agency of nature itself, questioning whether art can serve as a medium through which the nonhuman
                    speaks.

            <h2>Snapshots of life “人生照片”</h2>
            <p class="subtitle">Still Picture Scoring from the Scavenging photograph collection</p>
            <p>My inspiration came from the warmth, the plants, and the autumn feeling that the photo conveyed. In my
                imagination, the window separates two contrasting worlds — the cold air outside and the cozy, safe, and
                gentle atmosphere inside. To capture that contrast, I chose warm guitar tones and vocals to express the
                main melody, and added lo-fi synth textures to evoke the grainy quality of film photography.</p>
            <p>Scavenging is my third photography book, a quiet reflection on three years of image-making. Divided into
                three chapters—2020, South Shore, and Crossing the Bridge—it traces a personal and collective memory
                shaped by isolation, youth, and change.</p>

            <p>captures fragments from daily walks during lockdown, when the world slowed down to silence.South
                Shore refers to a small community in Yanjiao, where I lived alone during my final years of school.
                Surrounded by friends and neighbors, we cooked, drank, talked, and studied together—a brief, tender
                world recorded not by camera, but by phone: simple, direct, and sincere.</p>

            <p>As The Sheltering Sky reminds us, certain afternoons become inseparable from who we are; these images
                hold that kind of memory.</p>

            <p>Crossing the Bridge reflects the passage between Beijing and Yanjiao, a border charged with exams,
                restrictions, and fleeting hope.</p>
            <p>Together, these photographs form an intimate diary of resilience and belonging amid uncertain times.</p>

            <h2>The Other Side (from Emily & Sue)</h2>
            <p class="subtitle">Music by Dana Kaufman<br>
                Libretto by Aiden K. Feltkamp, with text by Emily Dickinson and Susan Huntington Gilbert Dickinson</p>
            <p>Emily & Sue is an a cappella pop opera/musical by Los Angeles-based composer Dana Kaufman and librettist
                Aiden K. Feltkamp. The piece—which was commissioned by Amherst College/The Emily Dickinson Museum—exists
                in album, live performance, and film formats. The film version of the opera was directed by Ron
                Bashford, created in collaboration with Four/Ten Media, and filmed in Dickinson’s actual room. Soprano
                Jasmine Muhammad and the Iris Vocal Trio star in the album and film.</p>
            <p>The “popera” focuses on the little-known romantic relationship between Emily Dickinson and her
                sister-in-law, Susan Huntington Gilbert Dickinson. Emily spent much of her life in seclusion and
                particularly in her room, where Emily & Sue takes place. Letters between Emily and Sue, as well as
                Emily’s poetry, document an intimate relationship that was not socially acceptable or legally recognized
                in 19th-century Massachusetts; the plot of Emily & Sue extrapolates from their correspondences.</p>
            <p>When the opera opens, Emily sits in her room writing on the evening before her brother, Austin, and
                future sister-in-law Sue are to leave for their impending wedding. Suddenly, a letter from Sue slides
                into her room. Within it, Sue asks Emily to meet her at dawn so they can travel to the wedding together.
                Emily, torn between her desire to support Sue and her intense romantic love, spends the night
                contemplating her decision. Morning arrives and Emily despairs. Then (in this clip, “The Other Side”),
                there’s a knock at the door—it is Sue. The two have a conversation through the door. When Emily does not
                come out of her room, Sue leaves. At the end of the opera, Emily considers how her life will be from now
                on, and how hope can sustain her even though she cannot be with the love of her life.</p>
            <p>It is up to the audience to decide whether Sue actually leaves Emily a letter and comes to her door, or
                if the events simply take place in Emily’s head.</p>

            <h2>Work Phone Sleep</h2>
            <p>Work Phone Sleep is a performance artwork by Ziwei Tang, portraying the monotony and pressure of
                contemporary life. In the piece, the artist repeatedly writes the words “work,” “phone,” and “sleep” on
                a blank sheet of paper until it is completely filled—an act reflecting the endless routine many
                experience under modern social and economic pressures.</p>
            <p>The accompanying sound composition by Monstar Cao amplifies this tension through a collage of over forty
                recorded voices, each reciting “work, phone, sleep” at different speeds and tones. Through multiple
                layers of cutting, looping, and random editing, these once-familiar words begin to fragment and mutate
                in the listener’s ear—sometimes forming entirely new syllables or phantom words. This sonic illusion
                blurs meaning and noise, mirroring the psychological distortion of repetition itself, and deepens the
                work’s critique of exhaustion, technology, and the collapse of individuality in a hyper-mechanized

                <p>Ziwei Tang is an artist based in London whose practice explores the intersections of ecology,
                    spirituality, and posthuman thought. Drawing from anthropology and shamanic traditions, her work
                    investigates the perceptual and ethical structures that shape the relationship between human and
                    nonhuman beings. Through installation, sound, and ritual interventions, she seeks to evoke the
                    agency of nature itself, questioning whether art can serve as a medium through which the nonhuman
                    speaks.
